ssh-keygen
Then you'll need to copy the new key to your server:

ssh-copy-id user@host
## or if your server uses custom port no:
ssh-copy-id "user@host -p 1234"
After the key is copied, ssh into the machine as normal:

ssh user@host



After restart needt to remove old one

 ssh-keygen -f "/home/trevor/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 172.17.0.2
